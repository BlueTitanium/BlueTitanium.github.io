							<h2><a href="https://github.com/BlueTitanium/TicTacToe">Tic-Tac-Toe with AI</a></h2>
						</header>
						<p>This is the first project that I ever made. It was an assignment from my APCS A course at Bronx Science, but the assignment was just to create Tic-Tac-Toe with random AI. However, I really wanted to challenge myself, so I made three versions: Player Vs. Player Tic-Tac-Toe, Tic-Tac-Toe with the MiniMax Algorithm, and Tic-Tac-Toe with the Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm. Overall, I really enjoyed coding this project because, before that, I had this weird notion that algorithm design was difficult and hard to implement. While coding this, I discovered that it wasn't hard, as long as I broke everything up into steps. That mindset helped me greatly in future projects.</p>

							<h2><a href="https://bluetitanium.github.io/PhysicsFighter/">Calligrider</a></h2>
						</header>
						<p>The concept was a fighter game that relies on momentum and collision calculations all in JavaScript. I coded this with my friend. This was my first ever hackathon project. Something that I wasn't used to while programming this project, was the massive time constraint. We basically had 8 hours to code the entire thing. Another issue was that I'd never worked with JavaScript and HTML before this project. However, despite all of the issues, we ended up with a playable game, and considering the constraints that we worked with, I'm proud of the final product. The work on this project prepared me well for future hackathons and projects where I had a tough time limit. (MLH Local Hack Day)</p>

							<h2><a href="https://team-quasar.github.io/Pi-Collisions/">Pi Collisions</a></h2>
						</header>
						<p>The concept was inspired by a youtube video by 3Blue1Brown that claimed that the digits of Pi can be formed by counting the perfectly elastic collisions of two blocks and a wall. By following the laws of perfectly elastic collisions, momentum, and energy, me and my partner were able to write code that simulated the theory. The code works for up to 3 digits of Pi. This was my second hackathon project. This being my second hackathon, I'd learned a lot about time management and programming websites since and from the first hackathon. We were able to streamline the process and write efficient code and it lead to a website that looked nice and performed how I'd expect it to perform. We won the Best Computational Hack award at this hackathon. (AtomHacks)</p>

						<h2><a href="https://bluetitanium.github.io/CalculatorPlusPlus">Calculator++</a></h2>
					</header>
					<p>Calculator++ is a project that some friends and I created for the programmer humor hackathon. Showing off some web dev skills, we created a website that allows you to use a calculator in every base from 1-69. We first created the template for the bases, and after doing researches on mathematical bases, we created a python script to create pages that would function as a calculator for each base. It was a fun little project and it was nicely done. </p>

						</header>
						<p>Genesect's Galactic Advent is a game that is focused on speed and constantly increasing speed while maintaining your momentum. This is a game focused on speedrunning and there are two endings that the player can go for, an easy one or a harder one. It's much more fun to go for the harder one. This was my first game, and a project from my Game & App Development course. Although I'd dabbled in Unity before this project, this is the first time I made a game with it. I learned a lot about game development and design through this project. It was really fun to program, and to get friends to game test with me. I really enjoyed it when my friends enjoyed playing the game. </p>

							<h2><a href="https://bluetitanium.itch.io/color-domination">Color Domination</a></h2>
						</header>
						<p>Color Domination is a simple 2-D platformer that takes advantage of artificial intelligence and aspects of my favorite games to create a parkour/puzzle game with several levels and difficulties. This game was made for my Game & App development course at Bronx Science. I made it with speedrunning and level design in mind. So I tried my best for every level to be completeable (although it is very hard) and I tried to make it so speedrunners could continually improve at the game with faster timings and rhythms.</p>
